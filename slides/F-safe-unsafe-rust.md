# Rust guarantees that references are valid

- their address is not `NULL`
- their address is well-aligned for type `T`
- they point into memory belonging to the process

These guarantees make rust memory safe

---
layout: default
---
# The borrow checker

The borrow + type checker ensures that these conditions are met

- We want a 100% guarantee that when the compiler says üëç
that really means our program is correct


- An analysis that is wrong in 1 out of 100 cases is worthless

---
layout: default
---
# The borrow checker is conservative

- "if it is not a hell yes, it's a no"

---
layout: default
---
# fail-proof borrow checker

```rust
fn borrow_checker<P>(program: P) -> bool {
    false
}
```

all programs that my borrow checker accepts are memory safe!

---
layout: default
---
# Hence

There are (many) correct programs that the rust borrow checker does not accept

---
layout: default
---
# Hence

There are (many) **useful** programs that the rust borrow checker does not accept

- interacting with other languages (FFI)
- interacting with the OS/hardware
- optimization

---
layout: default

# Unsafe, morally

In rust "unsafe" means "I, the programmer, am responsible for checking the correctness of this code"

The type and borrow checker are still in fully effect. But we can use types like raw pointers on which the conditions that the type/borrow checker places are less strict.

---
layout: default

# Unsafe in code


- unsafe blocks: "programmer must check the rules"

```rust
// BAD!
let reference: &u8 = unsafe {
    let ptr = 0usize as *const u8;

    &*ptr
};
```

- unsafe functions: "programmer must check the preconditions"

```rust
unsafe function foobar() {
    ...
}
```

---
layout: default
---
# Undefined Behavior & Optimizations

```rust
// std::hint::unreachable_unchecked
pub const unsafe fn unreachable_unchecked() -> !
```

- `unsafe fn`: to call this function, the programmer has to check the preconditions
- returns "never", the type of an infinite loop (diverging computation)

---
layout: default
---
# Undefined Behavior & Optimizations

```rust {all|2}
if expensive_pure_computation() == 0 {
    println!("hello there");
    unsafe { std::hint::unreachable_unchecked() }
} else {
    different_computation()
}
```

- that print is unreachable if the rest of the branch is unreachable

---
layout: default
---
# Undefined Behavior & Optimizations

```rust {all|2}
if expensive_pure_computation() == 0 {
    unsafe { std::hint::unreachable_unchecked() }
} else {
    different_computation()
}
```

- actually the whole branch is unreachable

---
layout: default
---
# Undefined Behavior & Optimizations

```rust
expensive_pure_computation() == 0;
different_computation()
```

- actually that whole condition does not need to be computed

---
layout: default
---
# Undefined Behavior & Optimizations

```rust {all|2}
if expensive_pure_computation() == 0 {
    println!("hello there");
    unsafe { std::hint::unreachable_unchecked() }
} else {
    different_computation()
}
```

becomes just

```rust
different_computation()
```

- but if the condition turns out to be reachable, behavior is confusing


---
layout: default
---
# Undefined Behavior & Optimizations

- misusing `unreachable_unchecked` is very explicit. There are many more subtle ways to introduce UB

```rust
// BAD!
let reference: &u8 = unsafe {
    let ptr = 0usize as *const u8;

    &*ptr
};
```

- the rust compiler assumes that references are valid, so this snippet contains UB!

# `transmute`

e.g. bitcast a `i64` into a `f64`:

```rust
std::mem::transmute::<i64, f64>(42i64)
```

there are still checks! `transmute` errors when the size does not correspond

```
error[E0512]: cannot transmute between types of different sizes, or dependently-sized types
 --> src/main.rs:2:12
  |
2 |   unsafe { std::mem::transmute::<i64, f32>(42i64) };
  |            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  |
  = note: source type: `i64` (64 bits)
  = note: target type: `f32` (32 bits)
```

---
layout: default
---

# `transmute`

Only some bit patterns are valid for a type. Creating an invalid bit pattern is UB!

Only `0b0000_0000` and `0b0000_0001` are valid `bool` bit patterns. This is instant UB:

```rust
std::mem::transmute::<u8, bool>(2u8)
```

The memory representation of rust values is explicitly undefined! Bitcasting is therefore very unsafe!

---
layout: default

# So Rust is just as bad as C?

- if memory safety can be broken, how is rust any better than C?

# Example: Memory consumption of linked lists

use LinkedList::*;

impl LinkedList {

        let mut list = Nil;
        for value in range.rev() {
            list = Cons(value, Box::new(list));
        }

        list
    }

    fn sum(&self) -> u64 {
        match self {
            Nil => 0,

# Example: Memory consumption of linked lists
